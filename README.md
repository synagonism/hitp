HitpLago-description
====
**HitpLago** is an html5.id.toc.preview WebApp text-document language for publishing title-content-tree documents with these advantages:

1. **Html5**: no need for special programs to read them, as all machines have the needed browser (= html reader). Also html5-elements structure the text for humans and machines.
2. **Id**: anyone can refer to ANY PART of them, because all their html-elements have IDs.
3. **Toc**: automatically created expandable table-of-contents makes reading easy. 
4. **Preview**: same domain link-preview makes reading fast.
