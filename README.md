hitp-description
====
**hitp (html5.id.toc.preview)** is a FORMAT (method) of publishing WEBPAGES (digital-texts | ebooks) with these advantages:

1. **html5**: no need for special programs to read them, as all machines have the needed browser (= html reader). Also html5-elements structure the text for humans and machines.
2. **id**: anyone can refer to ANY PART of them, because all their html-elements have IDs.
3. **toc**: automatically created expandable table-of-contents makes reading easy. 
4. **preview**: same domain link-preview makes reading fast.
